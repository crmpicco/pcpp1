# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

`__le__` - this method is used to implement less than or equal to comparisons. It should return `True` if the object is less than or equal to the other object, `False` otherwise.

`from abc import ABC, abstractmethod` - the `abc` module provides the `ABC` class that can be used to create abstract base classes. Abstract base classes are classes that are designed to be inherited from, but not instantiated. Abstract methods are methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclasses.

`@abstractmethod` - this decorator is used to mark a method as abstract. Abstract methods must be implemented by any concrete subclasses.
